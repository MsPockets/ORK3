What to do, if you want an internal deployment:

Change (optional) the following files/values:

src/net/pflaeging/PortableSigner/i18n_de.properties    HomepageURL=...
src/net/pflaeging/PortableSigner/Version.java          internaltag = "-Org"

you can change anything else like texts and default logo also, ...
These things are typically in i18n_??.properties or in Signatureblock.properties

Default Values for PS are changed in Preferences.java

After this compile and package the system.

The easiest way for Deployment on Windows is to take the 
PortableSigner-Windows.zip from your dist/ship directory anf unpack it under a
directory on the PC's. It doesn't need anything else like Registry except Java 
and the JCE unrestrictes Extension installed
