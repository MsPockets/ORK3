If you want to translate PortableSigner in your own language:

Translation of the User Interface:
- copy i18n.properties to i18n_xx.properties where xx is your two letter
    language code.
- edit i18n_xx.properties and translate the strings in the file.
- I'm using the build in language detection in Java. So the program should
    come up with the correct settings.
- you can test different languages with:
    LC_ALL=xx java  -jar PortableSigner.jar
    where xx is your language code.

Translation of the signature block:
- copy Signatureblock.properties to Signatureblock_xx.properties where xx is your two letter
    language code.
- edit Signatureblock_xx.properties and translate the strings in the file.
- in SignatureblockLanguages.properties add you language in the form:

    xx=longtext

    where       xx => two letter iso code
          longtext => longname of your language (in your language :-)
