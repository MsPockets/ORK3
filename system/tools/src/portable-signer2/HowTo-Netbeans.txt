Here comes a short explanation how to use Netbeans (I'm using 6.0 beta2) for developing PortableSigner:

At first: I'm using Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), so some things may work different on other platforms.
Mac OS X is a Unix/Linux type OS, so it comes close to Linux.

1. Checkout the project with git

2. Open it with netbeans.
    You will see some errors regarding not satisfied dependencies and libraries

3. Get the required libraries. You need:
    BouncyCastle Provider (bcprov-jdk16-ext-xxx.jar) http://www.bouncycastle.org
    Apache Commons CLI (commons-cli-1.x.jar)
    iText (itext-5.1.x.jar)
    QuAqua (quaqua.jar, libquaqua.jnilib)
    SwingLayout (swing-layout-1.0.x.jar) included with netbeans
4. Register the Libraries with the System:
    Tools -> Libraries -> New Library ...
    And this for every library mentioned in 3.
5. Get additional Tools:
    a) launch4j to generate a Windows .exe binary for the application and the installer
    b) IzPack to make a Windows installer package
    c) You should have installed GIT. Otherwise the version info in src/Version.properties will
        not be updated!
